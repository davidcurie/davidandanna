            <div class="w3-content">
                <h1 class="w3-center w3-text-white"><b>We Eloped!</b></h1>
                <img class="w3-round" src="images/couple.jpg" alt="Anna and David standing side-by-side at Lake Wenatchee, Washington" style="width:100%;margin:32px 0">
                <p>Our choice to elope was fraught with indecision on how best to proceed when we got engaged in the summer of 2020. A big wedding was out of the question for fear of cancellation. Our deciding factor to elope was based on the belief that if we would have to potentially wait up to 2 years to celebrate the way David had originally hoped, we would miss out on sharing other important milestones together. As David was due to move to another city for his career, he asked Anna to start a new life together with him. Setting up house together was a milestone we have been eagerly awaiting, and we found a way to celebrate our marriage alongside that milestone.</p>
                <p>Anna has been in favor of outdoor weddings with beautiful landscapes, and David would have a lot of extended family that might not share the enthusiasm for flying across the country and subsequently driving 2.5 hours to remote mountains to attend a ceremony, even if if offered breathtaking views. COVID-19 gave us the excuse we were looking for to sneak away and have a small, private wedding without putting family, catering staff, or venue hosts at risk. Our ceremony involved no in-person help outside of immediate family, and the cold weather kept the tourists and photographers out of the park which gave us the privacy we were looking for. The compromise we agreed on was that we would share the celebration with family and friends in person at a later date.</p>

                <h1 class="w3-center w3-text-white"><b>What's Next?</b></h1>
                <p>We are hoping to offer smaller-sized receptions in 2021 for you to celebrate with us in person. Our goal is to trade one big celebration with combined family and friends for multiple celebrations of smaller size and more congruent social circles that are timely spaced throughout the year. This increased number of celebrations comes with an increased number of costs and an increased burden in logistics, so we are trading a traditional reception for a cocktail hour or similar, less-grandiose event where people can come and go more informally. Think of it as a glorified family reunion where we get our money’s worth out of our wedding attire, you get an excuse to come out of hiding if you feel comfortable doing so, and we all get cake. Photos and dancing are optional.</p>
                <p>We would be happy to try and meet with you privately if you want to involve yourself in celebrating our elopement but can’t make it to or otherwise feel uncomfortable attending one of the informal gatherings. We’d like to space out these interactions 10&ndash;14 days after a large gathering for your safety, so get in touch and we can plan with you separately.</p>
